NOTE: Petri-net, FSM, State Chart: formal method to describe a system

== 3 types of diagrams / techniques
1. Formal : use math / logic to describe petri-net, FSM, State diagram
2. Informal : NL
3. Active Research tools (internet, os, ...)

== FSM vs State Chart/Diagram

.Differences
1. All circles vs all rectangles (long bar as init/base)
2. One-shot rec vs count number of 011: loop
3. Binary success/fail (non UML) many more effects
4. State + Event / pred unconditionally return

== Petri-Net
Super super set of FSM

Transition firing/blocking

*Firing*: for every input places the number of tokens should be >= the number of input legs;
if at least one of them have < # input then the transition is __blocked__

1. Draw one connected petri-net
+
2. Never connect 2 places / transition directly
+
3. EVERY transition / place have a name
+
4. Don't dot places randomly
+
5. More importantly, never have one powerful transition handling everything

== Banker's Paradox
Dox:

System has limited resources, more users +
Users only have partial res, no one can con. +
Deadlock: 3 sticks, have enough res for one banker to eat

1, 2, 3 sticks: deadlock +
>=4 sticks: 1 banker can eat, no deadlock

Relation to economics

Fair = *time sharing* +
many users time share the same server

== To Solve Deadlock
1. priority queuing + time
2. by randomized algorithm (quick sort, random)
