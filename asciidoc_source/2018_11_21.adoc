.Content, Common, Control (Good)

#Stamp Coupling# (level 4) : 2 modules pass more data necessary, waste space/bandwidth

#Data Coupling# (level 5) : all data passed btwn are

#Optimal Coupling# (level 6) : no direct relation

Coupling has 6 levels +
* symmetric +
* btwn 2 modules
* AB common +
* AC +
* AD +
* BD content +
...

Coupling has 6 levels

Cohesion has 4 levels

No relation is also a relation

Use matrix

== goto/jump

....
example:

B:
  ...
  goto flag1;
  ...
....

AB: coupling relation between these 2: content coupling

This is the worst possible coupling. AVOID goto

Dijkstra: late 60s. Use goto behind bars + in college

Industry: use goto

1. Why should avoid goto (more defense) +
* When to use goto or not, based understandability, OS, huge system +
2. Why should minimize global variable (defend)

== Mid level question : ~10 lines, < 20 lines

.A numerical value wants to find min/max
1. sorted -- O(n log n), too hard
2. min = A[0], max = A[0]
* prove we cannot do between than O(n)
* game theoretic argument: every element should be O(n)

....
min, max = A[0]
for i in range(1, N):
  if A[i] < min:
    min = A[i]
  if A[i] > max:
    max = A[i]
....

Gauss

FFT (fast Fourier transform) +
* solve first order differential equation O(n^2) +
* 1965 (Tukey & ___): reversed mergesort O(n log n) ~ O(n)


== Important algorithms
1. dictionary search/binary
2. hashing
3. quicksort/mergesort, FFT

.Find an efficient algorithm to find 2 neighboring elements such that A[i]<>A[i+1]
1. Check the mid value:  A[mid]
2. A[1] <>A[mid]: 1:mid, goto 1st half. Else A[mid]<>A[n], goto 2nd half

.Suppose you have a sorted array. Shift this array by unknown numbers. How can you efficiently find the minimal value?
* number of elements = q
* sorted array = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
* shift 1 = 5, 1, 2, 3, 4
* shift 4 = 2, 3, 4, 5, 1

Check the middle value. Compare the start value to the middle value.

.2D Matrix. n x n is huge. Along each row the values are sorted. Along each column the values are sorted. How can we find the query value q most efficiently?
| 1 | 4 | 6 | +
| 1 | 5  | 8 | +
| 7 | 10 | 12 |

Know how to bracket the desired value in the search space

*one solution* +
1. Check the center +
2. if center larger than query value +
3. safely throw out quadrant

*second solution* +
1. Check one corner +
2. q vs lower left corner +
3. q > val(corner) --> out one column +
4. q < val(corner) --> out one row +
5. get rid of one column or one row
