IMPORTANT: REPORT DUE: Wednesday, October 24

== Software Quality
Definition:: Measure of the goodness/badness of a software system
- Usability
- User Friendly
- Understandability
- Satisfy Specification (IMPORTANT b/c Only way to get $$)

== Life Cycle Models
1. Waterfall
2. Rapid Prototyping (con: Moving target)
3. Evolutionary Model +
* Reduce overall risk for both parties
* Improved communication
* < 5%, fatal problem +
  ** Hard to integrate +
  ** Revise/revisit large parts of early build +
  ** Only applicable to builds are relatively loose coupling +
4. Spiral Model
* At early stage of waterfall, add [.underline]#risk analysis# at end
* < threshold +
  ** DOD : failure rate < 1%
* Only good for large military/highly political system

=== System Reliability
Software parts, failure rate

1. Availability in Series +
  * If one fails, the entire system fails +
  * Given two parts, x and y, each with a failure rate of 10% in series, the total +
  failure rate is: `19%`, and success rate of: `81%`. +
  `A = A_x * A_y` +
  `.81 = .9 * .9` +
2. Availability in Parallel +
  * If both fail, the entire system fails +
  * If one fails, the system will continue to operate +
  * Given the same system as before but in parallel, the total failure rate is: `1%`,
  and success rate of: `99%`. +
  `A = 1 - (1 - A_x) * (1 - A_y)` +
  `A = 1 - (1 - A_x)^2` +
  `.99 = 1 - (1 - .9)^2`

[.underline]#Pros# : Safe, rigorous analysis

[.underline]#Cons# : Time + $$ consuming (expensive)

== Analyze System (Use Diagram)
* All possible point of views are exhausted
* Unified modeling language (UML)
* SE tools to describe system
* Use-case diagram is 1st UML
  ** def system boundary (rectangle)
  ** def system features/functions (ovals within rectangle)
  ** def users (ordinary users (left of rectangle), privileged users (right of rectangle))
  ** def connection between users + functionality

PRACTICE:: Draw a diagram for a library

=== Finite State Machine (FSM)
- Model logic/algorithm
- Binary Stream 0, 1, $ (end of stream)
- Arrow to indicate initial state
- Double circle to indicate final state

PRACTICE:: Create a FSM to recognize 010 and 101

PRACTICE:: Create a FSM to recognize even binary numbers

PRACTICE:: Create a FSM to recognize binary values `n % 3 = 1`
