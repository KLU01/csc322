== Data Compression

=== RLE
Fax machine

=== DPCM
Definition : adjacent data are of similar value cheap Compression

* Fast and universal

.Fast Fourier Transform `O(n^2)`, Fourier `O(n log n)`
FFT (signal) is the king of ny transform, basis of function/signal analysis

* data: space domain: image/time: music/sound/speech

.2D FFT
* natural image/sound
* most of coefficient = 0
* sparse representation
* line: Special sine/cosine curve (most widely)
* wavelets: small waves better results than FFT

.Hammer & Nail Technique
Treat every function as linear b/c 2D signal linear function is easier to analyze

.Newton
* develops calculus `delta x -> 0`
* fpg: joint picture expert group: FFT + DPCM + RLE + Huffman (entropy encoding)

.Compression
Compression shrinks delta x. Idea is to not shrink the domain of x too small and instead
represent the function as a total sum of some basis function

inner product = 0

energy = 1 (normalize)

Compression method should pass the Turing test (test of intelligence)

* threshold beyond reasonable doubt
** shopping/cheating in final exam -- 5% (can be considered too generous)
** murder -- 1% (can be considered too tough)

.mp3
* motion picture expert group No.1, mpeg3
* gives best possible quality
* passes Turing test
1. FFT: Keep small # of non-zero sine/cosine
2. Exploit human ear's weakness--hear loud sound: cannot hear anything
  - Data skipping: reduce data size

.Video Compression
* 1 sec, 25 frames (still image)
* Exploits something--temporal redundancy
** take the difference
* Also find the motion vector (that way we wont have to find the literal difference)
* Partition video region into cold(bk), hot(fore: journalist): 25/sec


== Qualities Desired
1. satisfy specifications
2. adapt--learn from utilities
* hardcode, evolve

== Expert Systems
Finite cases

....
Example: take elevator
1. Check door opens
2. Check direction
2a. Check space
3. Check there is a cart/floor (in case there is a malfunction)
....

NOTE: For coding questions, be clean--readable/understandable + logic (minimize global variable, avoid goto)+
Understandability: +
1. more comments +
2. meaningful variable names

== Coding
1. Choice of programming language
* legacy system
* availability
* expertise
* cost/benefit analysis
