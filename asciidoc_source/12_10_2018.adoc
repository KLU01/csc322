= Software Engineering

.Debugging:
* part of coding/implementation phase
* conform to spec-most important quality

.Testing
* incomplete induction: choose some cases to test
* Observation (non-invasive) vs. experimentation (actively test)
** experimentation >> observation. Get your hands dirty. Be hands on. Pose some cases, see consequences.
** see cause and effect--experiment(randomized testing)
* Tester -- software verification engineer
* Need negative mentality

.Static vs Dynamic Testing


.Verification
* Verify system conform to spec. basis is spec.
* insider job
* 1-1 mapping between system and spec sentences, paragraphs

.Validation
* verification + more quality measure
* user-friendly(GUI, user-exp)

.Double-Blind Test
* A common
* google vs bing
* minimalist bing: better pic

 * rigously test g>b:
* target: relevance
  ** how to judge goodness objectively
* double-blind tests:
  ** a common long list of keywords to searchc/query
** typicl non biased
** no ideal which engine is being used
** evalute the results have no idea
** 23% vs 21.9%
*** google vs bing
*** >1% you need at least 100
*** #of searches you should conduct to

.Examples of Where this is useful
* ccny:
* trump: verb win bridge
** more relevant
* two systems:test better
**  rigourout doublbe-blindness test
  **  blind to patients
    **      to doctors

* papers: single-blind(typically) only to the writer --> will favor the big  name contributor
        ** double-blind(to make it unclear who is going to grade the paper and who is going to write it) --> better to be more fair it is objective
** component testing: integration testing
* thread testing: chose a typical scenario like what should happen in a system

.black-box testing: treat the system a a black box, we don't know what is happening inside we just want to make sure that our input gives us the  correct output
* F: Input:INT Output:INT

* partitioning testing:
  ** randmly apply many cases to make sure they work properly
    ** f:encryption:p,n,0
      ***  more meaningful to  try prime, product of 2 primes
* input: string: Null
  ** single-char 2, 3,...... randomized length
  ** coding: put testing in mind
  * Much easier
.Whitebox
* glassbox/structural testing
* see thru: peteri-net/class diag/flow char
* test cases cover all important cases
* too diffiuclt

.Preference?
* in industry: which one is more popular?
* >95%
* for small subsystem crucial, like if you want to make srue that something is perfect you will test it using glassbox instead of blackbox
.Top-Down
* test the main function first and then the
* top down is more important: global/ higher level performace is more important than lower level
* pass grade : overall system should be working

.Alpha Version vs Beta Version:
* alpha: pass the internal testing
* beta: dynamic version : initially alpha
** eventually = delivered version
* delivered system:
** testing finished, maintanence starts
*** required maintenance: if bugs are found about specification, bugs should be fixed like customer service
**** collect complaint: more + more important complaints
**** life cycle : mini spec+design+ im+test
*** evolution: better or imporvement: not required
*** Software re-engineering vs. reverse software engineering
*** (forward) software engineering: spec+plan+desing+coding+testing+m
*** software re-engineering vs. the same system: use diff/better pl/ds/alg
*** reverse software engineering:
**** come up with design and specification for a already working product
**** AI/spying not the easiest thing to do. (companies do this but won't admit to it) more like program understanding
*** working system: legacy system
**** a system that is written in old format, languge, outdated language or structure .
*** sre: easier or more diff than conventional se:
**** its easier no need to think about how to design because there is already a working system to consult.
