== Application of Software Engineering
1. Medical (non-invasive treatment, personalized)
* BMI
** Different qualification for different countries and cultures--Underweight, Normal, Obese
* CT (radiation bad to body), MRI (safer)
** To us, same--4D, 3D space, 1D time
2. Military (non-invasive checking, surveillance)
3. Law Enforcements
* Bomb detection
4. Traffic
5. Auto Driving
6. Business (supermarket, robot)
7. Gaming

== Imaging
*Types of images*: gray scale, color image, 3D CT image, infra-red

* 3 bytes (c_r, c_g, c_b), 8 bit per color

*What is a video?* : image sequence

color to gray in binary
histogram
image processing
low-level
image understanding (computer vision, NLP, AI)

Humans eyes are limited to certain colors

Compression based on color

Run-length encoding (RLE): ROM burn in RLE algorithm encode binary stream into runs
