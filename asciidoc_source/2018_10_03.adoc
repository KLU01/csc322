== Top 3 Most Important Algorithms
- Binary/Dictionary Search
- Hashing O(1)
- Merge Sort / Quicksort / FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
  - DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) `O(n^2)`, 1965

.Time Complexity
- Binary Search `O(log n)`
- Quicksort `O(n log n)`

.Prove: (Master Theorem)
[.underline]#Binary Search#

T(n): a function of input data size n +
`T(n) = 1 + T(n / 2)` #Formulate DE (Differential Equation +
`= 1 + 1 + T(n / 4)` +
`= 1 + 1 + 1 + T(n / 8)` +
`= k + T(n / (2^k))` # Reasonable logic jump +
`= log n + T(n / (2^ (log_2_n) ) )` +
`= log n + T(1)` +
`= log n`

[.underline]#NO IDEA WHAT ALGORITHM BUT...#

`T(n) = 1 + T(n - 1)` #Formulate DE (Differential Equation +
`= 1 + 1 + T(n - 2)` +
`= k + T(n - k)`  # Reasonable logic jump +
`= n + T(0)` +
`= n`

.Steps:
1. Formulate recursive difference equation
2. Expand + observe to find function of n (FT/z - transform/generation function to solve)

== Coding
- Add more comments
- Assert / consider test cases
- Reliable / robust: be defensive: worry about OS, internet users' input
  Example:
  age = input("Your age:")
  vs.
  age = input("Your age (WARNING: integer, > 10, < 200): ") #Shift burden to users

== Maintenance
- [.underline]#SQA# System Quality Assurance (team of 50-60 Toyota)
  - invented by American engineer that was hired / adopted by Japanese
- Specification of all phases: SQA has final
- Independent, objective, powerful

== Pros & Cons of Waterfall Model

.Advantage:
- Better organization / principles
- Strict rules to proceed

.Disadvantage:
- Slow / Time consuming
  - lack of visualization
  - inflexible
  - lack of communication between customer, developer, testers, designers

== Prototyping
Build system quickly containing the major features (no minor details)
Reflect main functionality
Scripting / Prototyping language (python--advantage coding numpy-- + sql)

.Cons
- May not reflect all crucial features
- Not lone model
- More chance of moving targets

.Pros
- Improve timely communication among many parties
- Better feedback -> Ensure right direction

== Fast Prototyping (FP)
Not running alone
Associated with other life cycle

.Artist Rendering
FP receive better / more meaningful feedback

.Lifecycle is general concept. Waterfall is an example of a lifecycle.
