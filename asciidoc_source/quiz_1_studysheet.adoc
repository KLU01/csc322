= QUIZ #1 : STUDY SHEET

== Program Complexity

=== THREE COMPLEXITIES
1. Time +
* CPU / GPU
* Time it takes to run program
2. Space +
* Size of space necessary to run program
3. Kolmogorov

.Time + Space = Efficiency

.Program = Data Structure + Algorithm (Low Level)
Good for small data, but rarely good for big data.

=== Top 3 Most Important Algorithms
- Binary/Dictionary Search
- Hashing O(1)
- Merge Sort / Quicksort / FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
  - DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) `O(n^2)`, 1965

.Time Complexity
- Binary Search `O(log n)`
- Quicksort `O(n log n)`

.Prove: (Master Theorem)
[.underline]#Binary Search#

T(n): a function of input data size n +
`T(n) = 1 + T(n / 2)` #Formulate DE (Differential Equation +
`= 1 + 1 + T(n / 4)` +
`= 1 + 1 + 1 + T(n / 8)` +
`= k + T(n / (2^k))` # Reasonable logic jump +
`= log n + T(n / (2^ (log_2_n) ) )` +
`= log n + T(1)` +
`= log n`

Practice:: Chunk Swapping Problem: Swap a set of numbers

== BIG DATA
.What is big data?
1. Size: large +
2. Fast: continuous stream of real-time sensors +
3. Modalities: Data of different natures

== DEVELOPMENT OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

=== 4 Generations of Programming Languages
1. Binary
2. Assembly
3. Procedural
4. Object-Oriented

*Most Important Feature of an Object-Oriented Language :* Inheritance +
Why? +
1. Re-usability
2. Understandable
3. User-Friendly

=== Three Paradigms
1. Imperative +
* All programming languages (python, java, etc.)
2. Functional +
* Function = 1st class object--passed as argument
* No loops, all recursion
* No side effects b/c assignment disallowed--avoids changing-state & mutable data
* Lazy evaluation (good)
* Lisp, Haskell, Scheme, Scala
* Big Data
3. Logical Programming
* Prolog : hard to use for large problems

== 3 Types of People
1. Developers
2. Users
3. Clients (ppl w/$$$)

== Software Engineering

.Software Engineering Goals
1. User-friendly: Easy to use by users
2. Understandable: Easy to understand by your peers, boss, code reviewer, colleagues, yourself in the future.
3. Reliable / Robust : Be defensive
4. Assert / Consider test cases

.How to Make Code Understandable
1. Comments, lots of them.
2. Beautify your code.
3. Naming conventions - make name of functions and variables meaningful.
4. Write clean/smart logic. This is more subjective.

.Why is Software Engineering so difficult from other engineering disciplines?
ANSWER:: LACK OF VISUALIZATION +
Hard to communicate with clients/bosses

.Solution to Mutual Misunderstandings
1. Possibly with more Natural Language, but this might invite more confusion.
2. Math: Universal language, nail down the details.
3. Diagrams
4. Small model/prototype: Clients can see/visualize and provide informed feedback.

== LIFE CYCLE MODEL
Steps to proceed in a software system development to go forward and backwards.

=== Waterfall (Proper Bridge Building)
A sequential design process in which progress moves through phases of:

1. *Estimation & Planning* +
* Field work -- System Analysis (Needs, Budget, Personnel
2. *Design* +
* Low Level: Data Structure + Algorithm +
* High Level: # of modules, relationship btwn modules--architectural design +
3. *Implementation* +
* Build based on design (Coding + Debugging) +
* [.underline]#Debugging# is done on your own. +
** Goal: Make sure logically working. +
4. *Testing* +
* Stress testing (Different team to unit + integration test)

Different Types of Testing::
  ** [.underline]#Alpha#: Tested by insiders +
    *** Problem: More generous, not too harsh
    *** Paid individuals in another department or company hired
  ** [.underline]#Beta#: Tested by outsiders +
    *** Pros: More objective
    *** Time line will vary. Can take days, months, decades, centuries...
  ** [.underline]#A/B Testing#: 5% of users are chosen to test new GUI/features +
    *** Used/Abused by big companies like Google, FB, Amazon, etc.
IMPORTANT: Testing != Debugging +

5. *Maintenance & Repair (Bug fixes) & Evolution* +
* Maintenance is delivered by customer service +
** [.underline]#SQA (System Quality Assurance)# +
* Create different versions (control)
6. If beyond repair, retire / destroy.

[.underline]#*Pros:*#

* Better organization / principles
* Strict rules to proceed

[.underline]#*Cons:*#

* Slow / time consuming
* Lack of visualization
* Inflexible
* Lack of communication btwn customer, developer, testers, designers

=== Rapid Prototyping
* Build system quickly containing the major features (no minor details)
* Reflect main functionality
* Scripting / Prototyping language (python + sql)

[.underline]#*Pros:*#

* Improve timely communication among many parties
* Better feedback -> Ensure right direction

[.underline]#*Cons:*#

* May not reflect all crucial features
* Not lone model
* More chance of *Moving Target*: +
  In the beginning, users/clients tell you to make something.
  Once you are near the end, they tell you to do something different.

=== Evolutionary Model
Iterative and incremental approach

[.underline]#*Pros:*#

* Reduce overall risk for both parties
* Improved communication

[.underline]#*Cons:*#

* < 5%, fatal problem +
** Hard to integrate +
** Revise/revisit large parts of early build +
** Only applicable to builds are relatively loose coupling

=== Spiral Model
Waterfall + [.underline]#risk analysis# at the end of every step

* < threshold +
** DOD : failure rate < 1%
* Only good for large military/highly political system

== CASE (**C**omputer **A**ided **S**oftware **E**ngineering)
a. In every phase of development
b. Smart editor
  1. git
  2. gitlab (linux)
  3. make
    Smart compiling for large systems -> automated activity
c. Revision Control

== System Reliability
Software parts, failure rate

1. Availability in Series +
  * If one fails, the entire system fails +
  * Given two parts, x and y, each with a failure rate of 10% in series, the total +
  failure rate is: `19%`, and success rate of: `81%`. +
  `A = A_x * A_y` +
  `.81 = .9 * .9` +
2. Availability in Parallel +
  * If both fail, the entire system fails +
  * If one fails, the system will continue to operate +
  * Given the same system as before but in parallel, the total failure rate is: `1%`,
  and success rate of: `99%`. +
  `A = 1 - (1 - A_x) * (1 - A_y)` +
  `A = 1 - (1 - A_x)^2` +
  `.99 = 1 - (1 - .9)^2`

[.underline]#*Pros*# : Safe, rigorous analysis

[.underline]#*Cons*# : Time + $$ consuming (expensive)

== Analyze System (Use Diagram)
* All possible point of views are exhausted
* Unified modeling language (UML)
* SE tools to describe system
* Use-case diagram is 1st UML
  ** def system boundary (rectangle)
  ** def system features/functions (ovals within rectangle)
  ** def users (ordinary users (left of rectangle), privileged users (right of rectangle))
  ** def connection between users + functionality

PRACTICE:: Draw a diagram for a library

=== Finite State Machine (FSM)
- Model logic/algorithm
- Binary Stream 0, 1, $ (end of stream)
- Arrow to indicate initial state
- Double circle to indicate final state

PRACTICE:: Create a FSM to recognize 010 and 101

PRACTICE:: Create a FSM to recognize even binary numbers

PRACTICE:: Create a FSM to recognize binary values `n % 3 = 1`
